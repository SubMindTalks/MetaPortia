# TODO Implementation for MetaPortia

This document outlines the tasks required to implement and finalize the MetaPortia project.

## 1. Setup Project Structure
- [x] Create the folder structure as outlined.
- [x] Include necessary modules such as `github_fetcher.py`, `code_analysis.py`, and `visualization.py`.
- [ ] Finalize and verify the `config.yaml` for domain-specific configurations.

## 2. GitHub Fetcher Module
- [ ] Use GitHub's REST API to search for repositories matching specific domain keywords.
- [ ] Implement repository cloning with the `git` library.
- [ ] Handle errors like rate limits, private repositories, and network issues.
- [ ] Save repositories in the `data/repos/` folder.

## 3. Code Analysis Module
- [ ] Implement tokenization for Python files to extract meaningful sequences.
- [ ] Use sequence alignment algorithms (e.g., Smith-Waterman) to find repetitive patterns.
- [ ] Cluster similar patterns and identify stereotypical code templates.
- [ ] Save results as JSON or CSV in the `data/analysis_results/` folder.

## 4. Visualization Module
- [ ] Generate charts (e.g., bar charts, word clouds) for frequently occurring patterns.
- [ ] Highlight identified code templates in a human-readable format.
- [ ] Save visualizations in `data/analysis_results/`.

## 5. Testing and Validation
- [ ] Write unit tests for all modules in the `tests/` folder.
- [ ] Test the GitHub fetcher with different domains and ensure compatibility.
- [ ] Validate code analysis with sample repositories.

## 6. Documentation
- [ ] Write a comprehensive `README.md` for the project.
- [ ] Include instructions for setting up the environment and running the project.
- [ ] Document the purpose and usage of each module.

## 7. Deployment
- [ ] Prepare the project for public release on GitHub.
- [ ] Ensure `.gitignore` excludes unnecessary files (e.g., `__pycache__`, large repository clones).
- [ ] Add a license file (e.g., MIT License).

## 8. Future Enhancements
- [ ] Extend support for multiple programming languages beyond Python.
- [ ] Integrate natural language processing (NLP) to analyze comments and documentation in repositories.
- [ ] Develop a web interface to visualize and interact with analysis results.

## Notes
- This document will be updated as tasks are completed or requirements change.
