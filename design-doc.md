# Design Considerations for PortiaMeta

## Core Design Principles

### 1. Simplicity Over Complexity
- The DSL should feel natural to Python developers
- Macros should be intuitive and follow the principle of least surprise
- Complex features should be built from simple, composable primitives
- When in doubt, favor explicitness over implicit behavior

### 2. Safety and Reliability
- Strong type checking where possible
- Clear error messages with line numbers and context
- Deterministic macro expansion
- Protection against infinite recursion in macro expansion
- Validation of generated code before execution

### 3. Performance Considerations
- Efficient parsing and transformation algorithms
- Caching of macro expansions where appropriate
- Lazy evaluation of nested macros
- Optimization passes on the generated AST

## Architectural Decisions

### Lexer Design
- Token-based approach using regular expressions
- Support for nested structures and indentation
- Special handling of macro parameters and interpolation
- Preservation of source location information for error reporting

### Parser Implementation
- Recursive descent parser for clarity and maintainability
- Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) designed for easy transformation
- Support for both statement and expression macros
- Built-in support for pattern matching constructs

### Macro System
- Hygienic macro system to prevent variable capture
- Support for both statement and expression macros
- Macro parameters with optional type hints
- Support for variadic macro arguments
- Pattern matching integrated with macro system

### Code Generation
- Multiple passes for optimization
- Pretty printing with proper indentation
- Source map generation for debugging
- Integration with Python's AST module
- Support for custom code generation plugins

## Trade-offs and Decisions

### 1. Syntax Choices
```python
# Chosen syntax:
macro repeat(n, body):
    for _ in range(${n}):
        ${body}

# Alternative considered but rejected:
@macro
def repeat(n, body):
    ...

Rationale:
- More concise and readable
- Clearer distinction from regular Python functions
- Better support for pattern matching integration
```

### 2. Error Handling
```python
# Approach chosen:
class MacroExpansionError(Exception):
    def __init__(self, message: str, location: SourceLocation):
        self.message = message
        self.location = location

Rationale:
- Rich error information
- Support for source mapping
- Integration with IDE tools
```

### 3. Pattern Matching Integration
```python
# Integrated pattern matching:
macro match(value, *patterns):
    match ${value}:
        ${patterns}

# Instead of separate pattern matching system
```

## Security Considerations

### 1. Code Generation Safety
- Validation of generated code before execution
- Sandboxing of macro expansion
- Protection against code injection
- Resource limits on macro expansion

### 2. Input Validation
- Strict parsing of macro parameters
- Validation of pattern matching patterns
- Protection against infinite recursion
- Memory usage limits

## Future Extensibility

### 1. Plugin System
- Support for custom macro transformers
- Extensible pattern matching system
- Custom code generation backends
- Integration with type checking systems

### 2. IDE Integration
- Language server protocol support
- Syntax highlighting
- Code completion
- Jump to definition

### 3. Debugging Support
- Source maps for generated code
- Step-through debugging
- Macro expansion visualization
- Performance profiling

## Performance Optimization Strategies

### 1. Macro Expansion
- Caching of frequently used macros
- Incremental compilation
- Parallel macro expansion where possible
- Smart recompilation strategies

### 2. Code Generation
- Multiple optimization passes
- Dead code elimination
- Common subexpression elimination
- Constant folding

## Testing Strategy

### 1. Unit Testing
- Test each component in isolation
- Property-based testing for parser
- Exhaustive pattern matching tests
- Error handling verification

### 2. Integration Testing
- End-to-end macro expansion tests
- Performance benchmarks
- Memory usage monitoring
- Cross-platform compatibility

### 3. Property Testing
- Roundtrip testing (source → AST → source)
- Macro expansion properties
- Pattern matching completeness
- Error handling coverage

## Documentation Standards

### 1. Code Documentation
- Docstrings for all public APIs
- Type hints throughout codebase
- Examples in docstrings
- Architecture decision records

### 2. User Documentation
- Getting started guide
- Tutorial with examples
- Best practices guide
- Troubleshooting guide

## Version Control and CI/CD

### 1. Version Control
- Semantic versioning
- Clear commit messages
- Branch protection rules
- Code review requirements

### 2. Continuous Integration
- Automated testing
- Style checking
- Type checking
- Performance benchmarking

## Appendix: Example Usage Patterns

### 1. Basic Macro Usage
```python
macro repeat(n, body):
    for _ in range(${n}):
        ${body}

# Usage
$repeat(3,
    print("Hello, Meta!")
)
```

### 2. Pattern Matching
```python
macro match_with_guard(value, *patterns):
    match ${value}:
        ${patterns}

# Usage
$match_with_guard(point,
    case_guard((x, y), x == 0 and y == 0,
        print("At origin")
    )
)
```

### 3. Code Generation
```python
macro generate_dataclass(name, *fields):
    @dataclass
    class ${name}:
        ${fields}

# Usage
$generate_dataclass(Person,
    name: str,
    age: int
)
```
